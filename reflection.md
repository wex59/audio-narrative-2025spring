# Reflection
When I first heard about creating an audio file that tells a story or conveys change, my immediate thought was to use loud, dramatic sounds to emphasize a shift. Then, I remembered a recent news story about a UFO sighting in New Jersey, which inspired the idea of an alien invasion narrative. I brainstormed and settled on a plot where a person wakes up to a normal morning, follows their routine—brushing teeth, washing their face, making coffee, and watching TV—only for everything to be disrupted by breaking news announcing an invasion of Earth. The broadcast devolves into chaos, with buzzing sound, traffic horns, siren and panicked crowd screams, before fading out.<br>
Once the story was finalized, I listed the sounds I needed (e.g., alarms, footsteps, coffee brewing, TV static) and sourced them from Freesound.org. I created an account, downloaded the tracks, and imported them into Audacity. Since I had no experience with Audacity before, I watched the tutorial provided to learn how to arrange tracks, adjust volumes, use tools and apply effects.<br>
### Baseline Criteria
For the baseline criteria, I ensured the audio file met all requirements. The final project is 3 minutes and 27 seconds long and includes a clear narrative story that transitions from a calm morning routine to chaotic invasion of Earth. I recorded three original sounds myself: the main character’s voice, footsteps, and the news reporter’s dialogue. The audio also layers multiple sounds at once, like TV noise overlapping with sirens and screams. I created a credits file to list all externally sourced sounds and their permissions, exported a playable .mp3 file, wrote a README to introduce the project, and included this reflection. At the end I should have the project done on time.<br>
### Aspirational Inspirations
For the aspirational inspirations, I believe I met several of the requirements. I created a separate file that lists all the Audacity tools and effects I used for different soundtracks in the project called toolsAndEffectUsed.md. One of the most interesting techniques I used was applying a fade-in effect to the TV sounds and then overlapping them with the footsteps soundtrack. This combination effectively showed the main character walking toward the TV.

The most useful skill I learned was turning a narrative into a radio-style broadcast. Initially, I recorded the news reporter’s lines, but I wanted them to sound like they were coming from a TV. After researching online, I discovered how to use the Filter Curve EQ in the EQ and Filters section to create a "radio sound" effect for the breaking news report.<br>

The coolest part was creating a specific sound effect using just one tool. I wanted to simulate an unstable TV signal to hint at the start of the Earth invasion, but I couldn’t find the right soundtrack. Instead, I took a buzzing audio track, added moments of silence using silence audio selection tool, and overlapped it with the reporter’s dialogue. This created a sense of signal disruption, making it feel like something ominous was happening.<br>

### Peer feedbacks
I also took into account a suggestion from a classmate who listened to my audio during a workshop. They recommended overlapping the breaking news intro more with the reporter’s dialogue and adding a slight cut in the reporter’s line to make the unstable signal feel more realistic. I made these changes, adjusting the overlap and adding a cut to enhance the effect.<br>

Change: the highlighted part is the new cut off I’ve added and make the breaking news intro overlap more with the news reporter’s line.

Another suggestion was to include a text transcript of my audio file and a separate file listing the tools and effects I used for better clarity. I implemented this by creating two additional files: one with the transcript and another detailing the Audacity tools and effects applied to each soundtrack. These changes helped make my project more organized and easier to understand.<br>

Change: Created two files for a better clarification to my audio file

Additionally, I received positive feedback, and the audience was able to clearly understand what was happening in the audio file. This gives confidence that the narrative and sound design effectively conveyed the story.

### Conclusion
This project taught me how to transform a simple idea into a layered audio story. The biggest takeaway was learning to use Audacity and get experience with it.
