In this preview, I’ve set up the opening for my audio narrative. I’ve incorporated a series of soundtracks to depict the quiet, normal morning routine of the main character. Most of the soundtracks were found in Freesound. It begins with birdsong and some light traffic noise to establish the environment outside the character’s home. I think these subtle details create a sense of place and set the tone for the story. Alongside this ambient background, I’ve added sounds to illustrate the character’s actions: the sound of them sleeping, followed by an alarm to wake them up, and then a track indicating the character leaving the bed. To add a personal touch, I recorded the sound of footsteps, which represent the character walking to the bathroom. Then the main character starts washing their face, and brushing their teeth. These soundtracks collectively simulate a typical morning routine, setting a contrast to the events of the next scene. In addition to selecting and layering these sounds, I’ve worked on balancing the loudness of each track to make the soundscape feel more realistic. I think this is the detail that helps to immerse the audience in the character’s world and sets the stage for the story’s progression.

What I plan to do next: I’ll add sounds of the character making coffee, followed by a phone alert and breaking news broadcasting on the television about an alien invasion. This will transition into chaotic background noise, including alien sounds, screaming, and objects falling, to reflect the disruption of the peaceful routine.
