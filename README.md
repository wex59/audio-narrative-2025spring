# Introduction
## The Morning That Changed Everything
### Creator: Weini Xie He
This is a story about an ordinary morning that takes a terrifying turn.

The day begins as usual—an alarm clock rings, birds chirp, and a daily routine unfolds. Washing face, brushing teeth, making coffee, watching the news—everything feels normal. Then, a breaking news alert interrupts. An unknown force is invading Earth. The background fills with noise—panic, sirens, the chaos of a city thrown into turmoil. The sounds of everyday life are swallowed by fear, and then... silence. The world is falling into chaos.

Comments:

Describe: I can hear the sound of sleeping, waking up with the clock ringing, brushing teeth, waking, making coffee, and watching news, and so on.
Evaluate: First and foremost, the time is within the time limit, which is good. besides that, I can figure out what is happening in the sound clearly and I think the innovation of this story is great. It is very interesting! And you have meet the requirements in the criteria which is great.
Suggest: I think it would be great to use a fade-in at the beginning. Actually I think the work is great!


It was very clear that the beginning of the audio started in bed while sleeping, the morning birds were a nice touch signify morning. I would recommend blending the sleeping and the waking up noises over the alarm sound to make a seamless blend,
I think that it was nice that you overlapped the sounds of drinking/footsteps/tv turn on
It was great how the sirens faded in and overlapped with the glass breaking. I think it would be beneficial if the breaking news sound overlapped with the reporter a bit to cut off the dead space.
It definitely portrayed an emotional experience once the sirens and screams started.

Describe
The audio narrative describes the story of someone waking up in the morning, having there morning coffee and watching the news to find that Aliens are invading and the world is ending.
Evaluate
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must…
Play for 1:30-4 minutes: It does
Have something happen or change during the piece (e.g. a shift in location, a discrete event): The world ends
Contain at least one sound originally recorded by you: It does
Contain at least one sound not recorded by you, but which you have permission (e.g. Creative Commons license, fair use, etc) to use
List and credit file sources used, including your means of establishing permission: It does
Have three layers (tracks) of sound overlapping at least once in the file: It does
Aspirational Inspirations
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit may…
Use relative volume and other effects to signal distance: It does not, however, I don't know how it could seeing that it is from the perspective of a single person, and doesn't really focus on anyone else
Use left/right pan and low/high pass filters to create a sense of (locations in) space: You could make the sirens to the right and the horns to the left, to further convey the disorganization of the scene maybe?
Show evidence (e.g. from workshop feedback) that audience interpretation matches what you intended: I believe I did
Use Audacity effects or tools that are new to you: I did not hear anything, but it is possible that I just didn't notice
Include a text transcript of your audio file for accessibility and improved search: I could not find this

Additional Suggestions
This is really good, however, once the news turns on, the audio gets really loud to the point that it was hurting my ears, if that was the point thats great, but consider maybe making it a little quieter in the second half
