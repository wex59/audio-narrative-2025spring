## The Morning That Changed Everything
### Creator: Weini Xie He
This is a story about an ordinary morning that takes a terrifying turn.

The day begins as usual—an alarm clock rings, birds chirp, and a daily routine unfolds. Washing face, brushing teeth, making coffee, watching the news—everything feels normal. Then, a breaking news alert interrupts. An unknown force is invading Earth. The background fills with noise—panic, sirens, the chaos of a city thrown into turmoil. The sounds of everyday life are swallowed by fear, and then... silence. The world is falling into chaos.
